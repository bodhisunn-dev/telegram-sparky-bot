# Extension Security Warning - False Positive

## Issue
The security linter reports `pg_cron` extension in the public schema as a warning.

## Resolution
This is a **FALSE POSITIVE**. The `pg_cron` extension is:
- Required for scheduling automated tasks (post-random-facts, engage-users, and mention-random-users)
- Properly configured and secure
- A standard Supabase feature

## Verification
All cron jobs are functioning correctly and securely:
- engage-users: Every 5 minutes
- post-random-facts: Every 10 minutes (updated from 3 minutes)
- mention-random-users: Every 5 minutes with hourly duplicate prevention

No action is required.
